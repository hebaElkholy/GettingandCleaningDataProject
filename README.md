GettingandCleaningDataProject
=============================

This repo contains an R file called run_analysis.R, it has to be kept in the same directory as the data folder called UCI HAR Dataset. 

The scipt does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script outputs a text file called tidyData.txt.

The script contains self explanatory comments about how data is processed and cleaned.
